#Intro 

##What is D3?

##What is an SVG? Why do we care about them?

#Part 1: Setting up D3

1. Make a directory called `d3_tutorial`
2. Make an HTML file called `index.html` and a css file called `main.css`
3. Download D3.js and move it to `d3_tutorial`
4. Add the D3.js script to `index.html`

#Part 2: Let's make a bar chart 

##Axes

##Our data

##Add Some Bars 

##It's a little ugly...

#Part 3: Okay, what about a line chart?

##Axes. Very similar to the bar chart

##Drawing lines

#Part 4 Got it. Show me something fancy
albers projection with dots of differing radii (of average value)
label cities
add number on hover

## Now make it schmancy
